## About

This project uses [env-to-t3](https://github.com/nicnocquee/env-to-t3) to generate strongly typed code to read environment variables. All apps and packages would use the same environment variables. Follow these guides to use it in your app or package:

1. In your app or package, don't read environment variables using `process.env` directly. Instead, use the `env` package.
2. Every time you make changes (change the name, add new variables, delete variables) to the `.env` file in the `packages/env` package, you need to run `pnpm run build` from the `packages/env` package.
3. If you make changes to the `.env` file in the `packages/env` package, make sure to update the `env.example` file in the same package.
4. In the `env.example` file, make sure to include comments to explain the purpose of the environment variable.
5. Add a `#required` comment to the environment variable that is required. env-to-t3 will automatically add validation to make sure the environment variable is set.
