## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm
- Docker

## Getting Started

From the root of the monorepo project, run the following command:

- `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.
- `cp env.example .env` from the `packages/env` directory.
- Edit the environment variable values as needed.
- `./dev-bootstrap.sh` to bootstrap the development environment. The script basically creates symlinks to the `packages/env/.env` file to `.env.local` in all apps and packages.
