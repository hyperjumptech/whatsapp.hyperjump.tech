The register feature allows users to register their WhatsApp number and name. This feature is available at the home page of the web app.

## Behavior

- If the entered phone number is not a `user` yet, the user can register their WhatsApp number and name.
- If the entered phone number is already a `user`, show an error message that says the phone number is already registered.
- If the entered phone number is not a `user` yet but a `registration` exists and not yet expired, show an error message that says the registration is already attempted.

After saving the registration, the user will be redirected to the confirm page and a WhatsApp message will be sent to the user to confirm their number. The WhatsApp message will look like this:

```
Monika WhatsApp Notifier
Hello your_name,

Thank you for using Monika WhatsApp Notifier!

Please click this link to confirm your phone number: https://wa-hyperjump-tech.netlify.app/confirm/some_random_token

This link will be expired at 2025-09-03T20:55:44.873Z
Sent by Hyperjump Tech (https://hyperjump.tech)
```

Once they confirm, the registration will be saved and the user will be redirected to the confirm page. The user will also receive another WhatsApp message with the instructions to use Monika with WhatsApp. In this message, they will be given the unique webhook URL to use in their Monika configuration. This webhook URL points to the [notify-api](https://github.com/hyperjumptech/whatsapp.hyperjump.tech/tree/main/apps/notify-api) app. The WhatsApp message will look like this:

```
Here's your webhook URL:
https://monika-notify-api.netlify.app/api/notify?token=some_random_token

You can use it to get a notification from Monika by adding it to the configuration as follows.

notifications:

  - id: 'monika-whatsapp-notifier'
    type: 'monika-notif'
    data:
      url: https://monika-notify-api.netlify.app/api/notify?token=some_random_token
