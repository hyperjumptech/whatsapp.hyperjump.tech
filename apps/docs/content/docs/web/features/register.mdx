The register feature allows users to register their WhatsApp number and name. This feature is available at the home page of the web app.

## Behavior

- If the entered phone number is not a `user` yet, the user can register their WhatsApp number and name.
- If the entered phone number is already a `user`, show an error message that says the phone number is already registered.
- If the entered phone number is not a `user` yet but a `registration` exists and not yet expired, show an error message that says the registration is already attempted.

After saving the registration, the user will be redirected to the confirm page and a WhatsApp message will be sent to the user to confirm their number.
