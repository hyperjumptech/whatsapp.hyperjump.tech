description: Resend a confirmation message to a user

The resend feature allows users to resend a confirmation message to their WhatsApp number. This feature is available at the home page of the web app with the "Resend" tab. (`/?tab=resend-instruction`)

## Behavior

- If the entered phone number does not have a webhook token, show an error message that says the phone number is not registered.
- If the entered phone number has a webhook token but the resend at is in the future, show an error message that says the resend is too soon so the user can try again later.

After resending the confirmation message, a WhatsApp message will be sent to the user to confirm their number.
