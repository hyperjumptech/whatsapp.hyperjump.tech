The notify-api is the backend of the Monika Notification Service. It is built with

- [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)

The main app server is in the `apps/notify-api` directory. It contains the main implementation and the tests of the notify-api.

On the other hand, the production API is currently (as of September 2025) deployed on [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) from the `apps/notify-api-netlify` app. This `notify-api-netlify` app imports the `notify-api` app and serves it as a Netlify Function.

This separation is done to make it easier to deploy the API to other platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, etc, if needed. Simply create another app that imports the `notify-api` app and serves it as a function.
