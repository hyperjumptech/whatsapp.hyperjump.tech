description: Testing for the project

This project uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev) to write tests. To run the tests, you need to run the following command first from the root of the monorepo project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That will start the local PostgreSQL database that will be used by the tests.

Then run the tests with the following command from the root of the monorepo project:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run the tests with coverage, you can run the following command from the root of the monorepo project:

```bash
pnpm coverage
```

You can also run the tests inside each app or package. For example, to run the tests inside the `web` app, you can run the following command from the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To run the tests with coverage inside the `web` app, you can run the following command from the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
pnpm coverage
```
