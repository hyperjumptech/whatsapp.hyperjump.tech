description: Testing for the project
---

This project uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev) to write tests. To run the tests, you need to run the following command first from the root of the monorepo project:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

That will start the local PostgreSQL database that will be used by the tests.

Then run the tests with the following command from the root of the monorepo project:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

To run the tests for all apps and packages with coverage, you can run the following command from the root of the monorepo project:

```bash
pnpm run coverage:combined
```

The coverage report location will be displayed in the output of the command.

You can also run the tests inside each app or package. For example, to run the tests inside the `web` app, you can run the following command from the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

To run the tests with coverage inside the `web` app, you can run the following command from the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
pnpm run coverage
```
